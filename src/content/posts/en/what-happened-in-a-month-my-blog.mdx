## Where have I been?
I was working on updating an old site that I did a year ago, a customer asked me to 
to update the site, so that's what I've been doing.)

## Well, and I didn't forget to update my site

<span class="space-y-xl"></span>

**Updated:**
<span class="space-y"></span> 

    1. Updated user interface
	2. Updated style file
	3. Fixed a bug where <code>@tailwindcss/typography </code> was not being applied to the blog
	4. Added automatic sorting of posts by date, from new to old
	5. Removed unnecessary code from input.css
    6. Added astro-compress package to compress files during project build, default settings: <code> CSS: true, HTML: false, Image: true, JavaScript: true, SVG: false </code>

<span class="space-y-xl"></span>

**What I plan to do in future updates:**
<span class="space-y"></span> 

 1. Add pagination to the blog page
 2. Integrate i18n, translate the site into another language
 3. Add sitemap.xml generation
 4. Maybe add some hedless cms
