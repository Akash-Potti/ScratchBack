## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please open an issue in the GitHub repository. We aim to confirm the receipt of your report within a week. After our initial assessment, we will keep you updated as we work to address the issue. We appreciate your patience during this process. If we confirm the vulnerability, we will work towards releasing a security update and give credit to the reporter in the release notes. If we decline the report, we will provide an explanation.
